# RSA Implementation in C
This project is an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm in the C programming language, developed for a Discrete Mathematics class project in the Computer Science program at the Federal University of Alagoas - Macei√≥ Campus.

## Overview
RSA is a public-key cryptography algorithm used for securing data transmission over insecure networks. The algorithm is based on prime numbers and modular arithmetic.


To implement this project, we created a bigint data structure where each digit of a number is stored in an array, allowing us to perform operations on large numbers.
